            <strong>Hi, I'm Allan.</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
            I've never really particularly enjoyed playing the violin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Probably because I only really ever played classical music.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still do but the only difference now is that I also play songs I enjoy
        </p>
        <p>
            at the end of my practice sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            By including pieces I enjoyed at the end,
        </p>
        <p>
            It made practice that much more bearable.

            <strong>What qualifications do I have?</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have been playing violin on and off for around 21 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was 15, because of my rebellious attitude, my teacher
        </p>
        <p>
            told my parents honestly that paying for lessons would be
        </p>
        <p>
            a waste of money. But now at 28 years old, I decided to pick
        </p>
        <p>
            up the violin again. I still don't practice as much as I would like.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, gradually, I am starting to practice more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have passed the ABRSM Grade 7 violin exam with Merit
        </p> 
        <p>
            and I have a distinction in ABRSM Grade 5 Theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working towards ABRSM Grade 8 and my goal
        </p>
        <p>
            is to pass that with Distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a <a href="https://youtube.com/@allanviolin">YouTube channel</a> with over 40 subscribers and 6000 views.
